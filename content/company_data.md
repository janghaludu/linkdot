Title: Company Registration Trends in India

So much has been said and written about *rising* India and the start up revolution that's currently slithering around. Let's explore this and the everchanging landscape of Indian companies using company registration trends based on data gathered from [data.gov.in](http://data.gov.in) and [MCA](http://mca.gov.in). We monitor these trends closely at QuickCompany, a data driven startup to the bones that focuses on company registration and trademark services, it being our bread and butter and everything. As I write this, there are more than 1.66 million companies registered with the MCA(Private Limited, LLPs, OPCs and Foreign Companies combined). Contrary to some reports citing April 2016 data, this number is growing at a healthy rate of about 300 companies a day on an average. That anomaly in April was due to the MCA site malfunctioning and not a decrease in company registrations! 


##  Identifying the phases.

<img src="../images/qcgr4815.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>

As you can see from the graph above, post-independence, we are looking at four phases. 

- 1947 - 1969 - Protectionist Phase
- 1970 - 1984 - Relaxation of regulation of industries
- 1985 - 2005 - Reforms kick in
- 2006 - 2015 - Product Frenzy


Before I plotted this data, my lack of knowledge on Independent India's history not withstanding, I intuitively expected the company registration growth rate to be divided into three phases - **Pre-Liberalization**, **Post-Liberalization** and **Late 2000s -2015**. I expected to see bumps in: 
- Early **90**s as a result of the big ticket reforms. 
- Mid-Late **2000**s - Early **2010**s owing to the ecommerce rage picking up steam - around the time of eBay's entry point or Flipkart's *coronation* point or the time around which *product* companies that screamed quality like Freshdesk started popping up.
- **2015** because of the perceived increased interest in **startups** in public discourse.

## Anomalies


Back to the graph. The company registration numbers graph turned out to be very much in line with *my* expectations, except for the

* Curious case of the growth rate in mid 1980s matching that of the 90s and 2000s. There surely was a bump in mid 90s but that quickly settled down to the respectable rate of mid 1980s.

* Absence of a significant uptick in 2015, given how deep *startups* penetrated the mainstream mindshare last year, be it in general discussions or enquiries of inquisitive landlords and wary matchmakers. 
    
Not being a seasoned economist myself, I consulted my partner at QuickCompany, who eats and drinks this kind of stuff. He then explained me how, contrary to popular perception, the reforms have been kickstarted in 1980s itself, 1985 to be precise and the big ticket reforms of 1991 were but an extension of the 1985 reforms, albeit on a much larger scale and executed systematically. Some minor reforms were introduced during the early 70s too apparently which accounts for the *second phase* in the graph. We will deal with the question of flat 2015 results later. 

- In each one of these phases, except for the 1971-84 phase, growth appears to be fairly linear. In case you are curious, R-squared values for all the phases are over 0.99 except for the 1971-84 phase, which is around 0.92. 
- The data from 1985-2015 fits snugly in an exponential graph with an R-squared value of greater than 0.994. 

You and I are of course smart enough to know that we can overfit data to see what we want to and make grandiose  statements, so let's just refrain from it. Without further ado, I present to you, graphs of all the phases

## Trends in Business Categories


<img src="../images/trends_business_activities.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>



Every company that is registered in India falls under one of the following categories:

- Finance 
- Manufacturing 
- Business Services
- Trading 
- Construction
- Agriculture and Allied Activities
- Real Estate and Renting 
- Community, personal & Social Services
- Transport, storage and Communications
- Mining & Quarrying
- Electricity, Gas & Water companies
- Insurance

Manufacturing comprises 9 categories. For the sake of convenience, I have grouped them all under the **Manufacturing** umbrella.

All technology related companies are registered under **Business Services** category. 

Until 2006, except for two years in **1999** and **2000**, most of the companies that were being registered fell under the **Manufacturing** category. As you can see from the graph, about **42%** of all the companies that were registered before 91 reforms are **Manufacturing** companies followed by **Business Services** and **Finance** at a distant **13%**.

It was in the year **1999** that the number of **Business Services** companies registered overtook that of **Manufacturing** for the first time. **2000** followed a similar trend but **Manufacturing** took the lead back in the years **2001-06**. From the year **2007** onwards, it has been **Business Services** all over. As of **2015**, we have almost one half of all the companies that are being registered fall under **Business Services**.


    
## Statewise Distribution & Growth rates



<img src="../images/qcstates_overall.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 600px;"/>


- **Maharashtra** and **Delhi** put together account for more than **35%** of all the companies ever registered. 
- **Uttar Pradesh**, **Haryana**, **Karnataka**, **Bihar** and **Telangana** have registered the highest growth rates in the span of **2005-15**.
- Growth rate of **UP** and **Haryana** has much to do with the establishment of satellite cities **Gurgaon** and **Noida**.
- **West Bengal** has had a huge dip in the yearly number of company registrations from **2013** onwards.

### Startups

All this is well and good. But how come it looks as if the company registrations peaked in 2012, as opposed to what you and I have experienced over the last couple of years? Didn't the start up buzz hit it's peak in 2015? We've even had a web series, made on the startup experience last year. I personally felt the start up buzz captured a lot of attention in 2015 and have seen a good number of people within my circles quitting jobs in pursuit of crafting their own product. But the data doesn't seem to support it though. Let's see if we can figure this out.

What the data tells you is that the total number of companies registered, though increased substantially compared to 2014, is still a tad less than the numbers in 2012. What we need to explore is the number of *startups* that are being registered over the past few years as opposed to all types of companies that are being registered.

What makes a company a startup anyway?
According to he U.S. Small Business Administration:
> "In the world of business, the word "startup" goes beyond a company just getting off the ground. The term startup is also associated with a business that is typically technology oriented and has high growth potential. "

At the expense of sounding like an exclusivist pig, in the Indian context, I would like to define a startup as a technology based company that operates with bare minimum resources. By this metric, we would be ignoring all the **startups** in categories other than Technology and those founded with a higher paid up capital.  

For a company to be classified as a *startup*

- It should be a Technology based company.
- It's Authorised capital should be less than Rs. 10 lakhs

Bazinga! There you have it. You can see a massive 50% increment in the number of companies registered in 2015. 

<br>
There are some other interesting things I investigated like semantic analysis of the company names, clustering of companies into networks based on connections, *distance* between company directors etc but discussing them over here would be stretching it. 

The entire analysis has been done using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy and Scikit Learn. All the graphs are generated using Plotly.
