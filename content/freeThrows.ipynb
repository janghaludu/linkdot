    "## Five Thirty Eight Riddler Express Problem - Sep 1, 2017\n",
    "> You’re hanging out with some friends, shooting the breeze and talking sports. One of them brags to the group that he once made 17 free throws in a row after years of not having touched a basketball. You think the claim sounds unlikely, but plausible. Another friend scoffs, thinking it completely impossible. Let’s give your bragging friend the benefit of the doubt and say he’s a 70-percent free-throw shooter.\n",
    "\n",
    "> So, who’s right? What is the number of free throws that a 70-percent shooter would be expected to take before having a streak of 17 makes in a row? And what if his accuracy was a bit worse?"

    "This looks like a pretty innocuous Bernoulli's trials problem but it isn't! Had the question been about the average number of throws taken for 17 successes, the answer would have been straightforward - $$0.7\\sum_{n=16}^{\\infty} n\\binom {n} {16}0.7^{16}0.3^{n-16} = 17/0.7 \\approx 24.3$$\n",

    "But the question we are dealing with is about the average number of throws that are required for 17 consecutive makes in a row. I have a vague recollection of this problem being dealt with in Feller's Volume 1 and it not being pretty at all.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "I fooled around a bit and tried to count sequences of the kind $S_20S_1$, where $S_1$ is a sequence of 17 ones and $S_2$ is a sequence of zeroes and ones of any length such that $S_2$ does not contain $S_1$ as a substring but gave up after seeing how this approach quickly degenerated into an absolute mess. Maybe a recursive way of generating $S_2$ sequences could do the trick."

    "At first, I thought I should replicate the entire process as it is, by doing runs of *shooting the ball till 17 consecutive throws are successful* and calculate the average number of attempts. For example, each run can be mapped to a string comprising only *s* and *f* characters, representing success and failure respectively, with one character generated at a time (with their respective probabilities), that terminates when *s* turns up 17 times consecutively. Repeat this a million times and calculate the average length of all these strings and we have the answer. This would involve setting up a counter for the number of times *s* is generated consecutively and resetting the counter to zero when an $f$ is generated and repeating it till *s* appears 17 times consecutively for each run. \n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "It then occurred to me that since these are all independent trials, I could just generate one long string of say 100 million characters, find all occurences of $S_1=sssssssssssssssss$ substrings in that and treat *every substring between two adjacent $S_1$ substrings* as a successful run(sans the success tail)! I must admit I am pretty pleased with myself here."
