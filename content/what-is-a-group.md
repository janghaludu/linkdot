Nope. This has absolutely nothing to do with Abstract Algebra. What we have here is a short film where one alien explains to another about musicians, producers, mixers and their social standings, capitalism, free market etc against a backdrop of performances, album covers, band photos and the song [Free Will](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXje4S74b0k). Poignant and hilarious at the same time. Made by none other than Ian Svenonius from Make Up, Nation of Ulysses, Chain and the Gang and *insert half a dozen more bands here*

>  As an embodiment of technical expertise, the engineer serves as the ambassador of science against the fantastical implications the group will invariably try to create. The engineer stands between what the group imagines and what the group actually creates.
